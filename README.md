## Overview

This was a feel good challenge for me as the UI was great and it did not take too long to code. I will probably make a dark mode version of this for kicks

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I started out just laying everything out. The challenge had some starter code i had to put into tags. After i got the basic layout done i started to add style to make it look like the part. I designed for mobile first then just used media queries to make it fir for desktop. After all that was done i added the hover state to make the website more interactive and then i finished it up with the background image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I had a hard time vertically centering the card so i want to work more with using vh or percentages to add margin to my elements
